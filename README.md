4. See the kit user guide for more details on configuring the board.

## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

This example requires no additional software or tools.

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

This tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example will clone the "[I2C EEPROM](https://github.com/infineon/mtb-example-pmg1-i2c-eeprom)" application with the desired name "MyI2CEEPROM" configured for the *PMG1-CY7110* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id PMG1-CY7110 --app-id mtb-example-pmg1-i2c-eeprom --user-app-name MyI2CEEPROM --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Operation

1. Ensure that the steps listed in the [Hardware setup](#hardware-setup) section are completed.

2. Ensure that the jumper shunt on power selection jumper (J5) is placed at position 2-3 to enable programming.

3. Connect the board to your PC using the USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector. This cable is used for programming the PMG1 device and as a USB-UART bridge to the PC during operation.

4. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=PMG1-CY7110 TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

5. After programming the kit, disconnect the USB cable and change the position on power selection jumper (J5) to 1-2 to power the kit through the USBPD port.

6. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

7. Press the user switch (CYBSP_USER_BTN) on the kit to initiate a write of 64 bytes of continuous data (0 - 63) to the I2C EEPROM (24LC128), readback and validate the written data.

8. User LED (CYBSP_USER_LED) blinks depending on the status of the I2C write and read:

   - LED blinks once if both the data write and read to the EEPROM are successful and the data read back is successfully verified.

   - LED blinks twice if the data read back from the EEPROM does not match the data written.

   - LED blinks thrice if write to the EEPROM failed.
   
9. Check for corresponding logs displayed in the UART terminal.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. Ensure that the board is connected to your PC using the USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector and the jumper shunt on power selection jumper (J5) is placed at position 1-2. Please refer to the "Debug mode" section in the kit user guide for debugging the application on CY7110 prototyping kit. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

## Design and implementation

**Figure 1. Firmware flowchart**

<img src = "images/flowchart.png" width = "600"/>
<br>

An SCB block configured as an I2C master peripheral is used in this code example. To implement the I2C master peripheral based on the SCB hardware block, I2C master peripheral driver library APIs are used. The I2C master is initialized with the following settings:

- Data rate set to 400 kbps

- Clock input to the block is connected to a 9.6-MHz PERI-derived clock

**Figure 2. I2C master configuration**

<img src = "images/i2c-master-configuration.png"/>
<br>

An SCB is initialized as UART to output debug messages and EEPROM data. To implement the UART data transfer on the SCB hardware block, the UART Peripheral Driver Library APIs are used. The UART is initialized with the following settings:

- Baud rate: 115200

- Data width: 8 bits

- Parity: None

- Stop bit: 1

- The clock input of the block is connected to a 12-MHz PERI-derived clock.

Upon user button press, PMG1 writes 64 bytes of data to the EEPROM, reads back and verifies the written data. User LED blinks depending on the status of the I2C write and read. 

Sample output on UART terminal is as shown below:
